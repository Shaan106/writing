SCALO unlocks new treatment options for debilitating neurological disorders and new research into brain-wide network behavior. Achieving the fast and low-power communication necessary for real-time processing has historically restricted BCIs to single brain sites. SCALO also adheres to tight power constraints, but enables fast distributed processing. Central to SCALO's efficiency is its realization as a full stack distributed system of brain implants with accelerator-rich compute. SCALO balances modular system layering with aggressive cross-layer hardware-software co-design to integrate compute, networking, and storage. The result is a lesson in designing energy-efficient networked distributed systems with hardware accelerators from the ground up.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 50th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture}, articleno = {72}, numpages = {20}, keywords = {low power, hardware accelerators, BCI, brain-computer interfaces}, location = {Orlando, FL, USA}, series = {ISCA '23} }

abstract = {Intracranial EEG (iEEG) performed during the pre-surgical evaluation of refractory epilepsy provides a great opportunity to investigate the neurophysiology of human cognitive functions with exceptional spatial and temporal precisions. A difficulty of the iEEG approach for cognitive neuroscience, however, is the potential variability across patients in the anatomical location of implantations and in the functional responses therein recorded. In this context, we designed, implemented, and tested a user-friendly and efficient open-source toolbox for Multi-Patient Intracranial data Analysis (MIA), which can be used as standalone program or as a Brainstorm plugin. MIA helps analyzing event related iEEG signals while following good scientific practice recommendations, such as building reproducible analysis pipelines and applying robust statistics. The signals can be analyzed in the temporal and time-frequency domains, and the similarity of time courses across patients or contacts can be assessed within anatomical regions. MIA allows visualizing all these results in a variety of formats at every step of the analysis. Here, we present the toolbox architecture and illustrate the different steps and features of the analysis pipeline using a group dataset collected during a language task.}
